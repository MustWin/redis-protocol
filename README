A very fast Redis client for the JVM.

Description of each module:

client/
  Leverages the protocol module for encoding and decoding. Supports both synchronous
  and asynchronous pipelined requests from the RedisClient. Supports 2.6 commands.
protocol/
  Redis protocol encoder / decoder based on input/outputstreams. This is the
  fastest implementation if blocking i/o is ok for your use case.

benchmark/
  A redis-benchmark clone that uses this Java client for comparison testing.

redisgen/
  Scrapes the redis.io/commands page and produce various clients and servers

loader/
  Utility to parse HDFS line-oriented files and load them into Redis

netty/
  A netty 3.5.X compatible codecs for building Redis clients
netty4/
  A netty 4.0.0.Alpha1 compatible codec for building Redis clients

finagle/
  A finagle 5.X compatible netty codec factory for building Redis clients
finagle-service/
  A finagle 5.X compatible service that doesn't use netty


util/
  Some library functions used by both the blocking client and the netty clients

server/
  An attempt at a server again
