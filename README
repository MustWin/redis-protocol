The intention of this project is to make a complete replacement for Redis in Java. Early prototypes suggest
that we can increase performance by as much as 2x. Further, it will act as a nice experimentation platform
for various I/O and GC optimizations. The storage engine will be pluggable so you will be able to use almost
any backend store.
