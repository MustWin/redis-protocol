The Redis client in this repository is faster, in my tests, than the redis-benchmark application that comes with Redis.
Still smoothing out the edges.

Description of each module:

client/
  Leverages the protocol module for encoding and decoding. Supports both synchronous
  and asynchronous pipelined requests from the RedisClient.
clientgen/
  Scrapes the redis.io/commands page and produces the typed Java client and the
  Finagle-based Scala client.
finagle/
  Based on the Netty codec, this provides a Finagle based client.
native/
  An experiment in combination with spullara/redis allows you to start up a Redis
  instance in a Java process and call it directly through JNI.
netty/
  A channel buffer based protocol implementation wrapped in a Netty codec. I am
  currently trying to push this upstream to Netty as a default codec.
protocol/
  Redis protocol encoder / decoder based on input/outputstreams. This is the
  fastest implementation if blocking i/o is ok for your use case.
server/
  Very, very rough, incomplete Java based Redis clone. Do not use.
